      The Shaper is a handheld wood cutter that is moved by hand to cut wood. It uses cameras on the front of it to 
      build a virtual enviornment for itself and projects a picture of what it is cutting onto a screen so 
      that the user can see it. It has a bit that spins very fast and slowly cuts out wood at a certain height. 
      The machine also has a different bit that is tapered so that it can engrave words onto wood. The initials 
      on my design were made by this and that is why they look different.

  <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
    The first thing you have to do for tha shaper is get your design onto the usb that goes in the shaper and 
    get yourself a piece of wood. The shaper is only used on a specific sized piece of wood, which means you 
    have very little choice in that department
    </p></font>

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
    The second step is to attact the wood to the table. This is done with a few strips of double sided tape, 
    as well as a screw in two of the corners, as shown above. Once that is done, you have to take a new scan 
    with the shaper itself. It uses the camera to orient itself and build the virtual version of the table. 
    Once this is done, you can place your design into the virtual world, making sure that it all is within 
    the limits of the piece of wood you are cutting.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
    Once the wood is secure, and our design is uploaded into the virtual world, you can move on to cutting part. 
    But before you put shaper to wood, you have to make sure you turn the vacuum on and make sure you have ear and 
    eye protection.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        Once your safety gear is on, alert everyone to the fact that you are about to begin cutting, and then you 
        can begin.

        I learned that you should begin with all of the inside cuts, and save the big outline cut for last. This is 
        becasue that once the outline is cut out, the piece of wood will have less support and stability. When 
        you go around for the second time, you leave little nubs connecting the project to the scrap wood. Then, you can 
        go back around with a hammer and chisel and break them. This ensures that the design is stable the whole time 
        you are using the machine.

        The first thing I did was play around with making shapes. I followed the tutorial that was in the shaper 
        week assignment and it helped me a good deal. I documented the process here. I just made a simple rectangle 
        with a circle inside of it.

        Once I had done a fair amount of just messing aorund in the program, I began to work on the actual project. 
        I statred with a fresh file. The first thing I made was a rectangle that was the size of the wood we were 
        going to use: 12.5 in x 8.5 in. This would work as an outline for the rest of the design process. Next I made 
        a smaller rectangle inside of the larger one, this would be the actual piece I was going to cut out from the rest.
        I curved the edges so that it would look better. Much like your video, I started by making the circle with 
        the smaller circle within it. This was one of the requirements of the project. Then I stared to build the 
        shapes that would eventually be the holes that would fit my stuff. I went with my wallet, my pencils, my thumb drive, 
        and my airpods case. I brought all of the items to the lab and measured them. I started with the usb, and made a rectangle 
        that would be the same size as it, I added a few more for good measure, in case on day I had a few thumb drives.
        I used lines to make sure they were equal distance apart from each other. 

        Next I moved on to the large wallet hole. Then to the pencil holes and the airpod holes. Originally I made a 
        few pencil holes, but later took out all but one becasue I feared it would be a lot of work to do many.
        
        Once I had all the holes I began to make the design 3d by selecting various pieces and adding height with 'e.'
        By making the frame and the piece itself highest, and the holes lower, it created the design I wanted. I then rendered
        it and added a wood texture.

        Then, with a little bit of trouble, I exported the file as a dxf, converted it to a .ai file, and then uploaded it into Illustrator.
        From there I copied the color chart, posted it into the file and began to color the different parts according to what 
        type of cut I wanted them to be.

       My cutting process wasn't any different from the first time I did it, when I was learning to. I used a lot of my photos 
       earier, so I added a few above that I hadn't shown yet. One it was all cut out I sanded it for a good while to make sure 
       that it was all smooth and that it looked good.
