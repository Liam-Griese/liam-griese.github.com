    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">I was smarter this week than I was last week, and I actually
      looked at the rubric for the Vinyl cutting week before turning it in. One of the requirerments that I likely
      wouldn't have done had I not looked at it, is to argue whether or not I believe that vinyl cutting is a 
      form of digital fabrication. I believe that it is a form of digital fabrication. Since you are using computers,
      which are digital devices to make something, I believe that it counts. As long as a computer is used to make it,
      I believe that it should count as digital fabrication.

    <p class="w3-justify"><b><font size="+1.5">Figuring Out What I Wanted to Make</font></b></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
      The first step of making anything is coming up with an idea. My idea was to put Jackson's face onto a T-shirt 
      because I thought it would be really funny. I texted Jackson basically right when I found out 
      I had to make a shirt and asked him if this was okay. He said yes, and that is where I got my quote from. 
       Jackson was totally fine with this and I got his approval several
      times throughout the process. The hardest part of the process was figuring out how to get Jackson's face to 
      actually look like jackson's face just using two colors: the cutout and the background. I used an online 
      tool for this becasue I didn't know how I would even go about approaching this problem.

    <img src="Photos/week two/Getting Image-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
      Here I cutout Jackson's face so that it could later be made into a black and white decal. There were a 
      bunch of sliders and I played around with settings on a few photos.
    </p></font>
    <img src="Photos/week two/finding the best jackson-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
      I used three different photos to try and get a good decal that would be simple enough to easily print, 
      but complex enough that it would be recognizable. I eventually went with the middle obe because I believed
      it to be the best photo.

      Here is me showing the various decals I made of Jackson to the man himself. Look how happy he is!

    <img src="Photos/week two/opened adobe-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
      Next I openned up adbode and statred to get to work on a T-shirt design. I set the width  to around 
      24 inches. Since I made the image myself I didn't have to deal with switching an image I found online 
      from a Raster Image. It was already a vector image when I downloaded it. The diference between a raster 
      vector image is that raster images are pixelated and will be blocky if you blow them up. Vector images 
      are made of vectors and lines so they are much cleaner when they are blown up to scale.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
      I didn't have to design very much in Adobe becasue I had done most of the designing in the online program 
      that helped to make the decal of Jackson's face. I basically just added the text, played around with the 
      font, and then saved it and stuck in on a thumb drive so I could go to the lab.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
    After I got to the lab I downloaded my design onto the machine and then uploaded the picture that I had 
    saved of my design to Sure Cuts a Lot. I measured the shirt that I was planning to use and scaled the print 
    so that it would fit well on the shirt. I think I made it around 15 inches across total. Then I turned the 
    vinyl cutter on, locked in the viynl, adjusted the speed and force accordingly, and started printing.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
      Once the vinyl was cut, I removed the piece from the printer with a knife and began weeding. Weeding is 
      the process of removing the pieces that were cut, so you are only left with the design you want. This 
      took quite a while and was somewhat difficult and tedious.

      <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        After the weeding was complete, I took the shirt over the the press and turned it on. I should have 
        let the press heat up for a while when I was weeding, but I forgot to do that. Once the press was finally 
        heated, I spent some time centering and flattening the shirt. I did a short press first to iron the shirt 
        before I added the design. After the first press, I lay the design on top of the shirt, made sure it was 
        nice and centered, and then pressed it down for 10 seconds. Afterwards, the piece of plastic peeled right 
        off and the shirt was complete.
