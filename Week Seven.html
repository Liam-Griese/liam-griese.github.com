    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        SLA printing is a form of 3D printing that involves using UV light to solidify resin in the form of a model. 
        It is very exact and much mnore precise than a tradtional 3D printer. This technology has been developed for a while, 
        but has only recently been advanced enough to allow small, hobby versions of the tech.

        I chose the video on designing a braided ring. I thought that overall this video was pretty good, it was 
        clear and detailed but it definety had its drawbacks. The greatest drawback was that there was on audio 
        to the video, so that the designer could not narrate what he or she was doing. This was especally 
        annoying when they would press the wrong button or make a minor mistake, becasue I would not be aware 
        that it was a mistake, and just assumed they were doing the correct thing, then the would go back and I would 
        realize I had been lead astray. This was really the only negative though, other than that, it was nice and detailed. 
        The video was clear enough that it taught me how to make a nice ring!

        So for the design process I basically copied the process that was shown in the video, but I did learn 
        a few new tools upon the way. The first new tool that I learned was the "Project" command. This, I am pretty 
        sure allows you to have a point be projected and highlighted, allowing it to be easily seen and worked with. 
        "Flange" was the second tool that I learned how to use in this project. Flange is much like the extrude feature, 
        it allows for a sketch to be made into a 3D object. I used it when I had to make a model ring to base 
        my design around. "Unfold" was the third tool that I learned how to use during this process. This tool allows 
        for a rounded or curved body to be unfolded to the same curve as another body. In the project I used this 
        to flatten the ring, so it would be easier to work with and edit. Then, at the end, the ring could be re-folded, 
        back to the ring shape. "Scale" is another tool that I learned how to use while working on this project. This one 
        is pretty self-explainitory, it scales an object. You can scale it from a specfic point which makes it very 
        usefull. I used this to make sure that the design would be the right size, and again at the end to make sure that 
        the ring was the right size. "Extrude" was another tool that I learned through the process. This is the tool 
        that I thought was the coolest and the hardest to understand. It basically allowed me to make a shape, in my case, a triangle with a point at the center of my ring.
        Then I could extrude the design so only the part of the ring within the shape was left. Then I used the 
        last tool I learned, the pattern tool, to recreate the extruded design about 7 times around the center of the ring, 
        so that a full ring formed.
