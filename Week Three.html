        This week in digital fabrication I had to make a box using a laser cutter. It was a fun process
        start to finish and I think my box turned out really well.

    <img src="Photos/week three/Picking out my box design.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        The first step in building my box was to design a template to use from boxes.py. There were 
        a handful of designs to choose from and I spent a while looking through them and debating
        which one I should make. I was looking at the living hinged boxes since that was one 
        of the requirements for our boxes. Living hinges are a type of cut that makes the wood 
        bendable and can allow for it to me curved and rounded.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        Finally I found a design that I was happy with. Now I had to make sure that it would fit on the 
        piece of wood we were allowed to use, which was 12" x 19". I ajusted the size of the various 
        sides of the box, until it was as big as it could be while still fitting on one sheet.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        After I had found a box design that I liked, and had made the measurements accurate, I had to 
        save it as an SVG file and import in into adobe illustrator. Once that was done, I could 
        go about adding my initials to the box.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        The first thing that I did once I got my design onto the computer in the lab was preform a test cut 
        to make sure that the pieces fit together and the measurements were correct. I did not get 
        a photo of the first test cut I preformed, only the result. The pieces fit togehter nice and snugly, 
        meaning that the box wouldn't easliy fall apart. This meant that everything was good and that I 
        could proceed with cutting out the rest of the pieces. Anoter aspect I forgot to mention was that 
        I had to go through and tell the machine what to cut, and what to raster. All the joints were 
        obviously cut, but the intials that I put on hte box were rastered.
      </p></font>

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        This second cut was much longer than the first one. The first test cut I did was probably around two 
        minutes, but the second one was around 20 minutes. The rastering, I realize, were what took up so much 
        of the time, because of the higher level of detail.

    <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">
        After a long 20 minutes of standing over the laser cutter and watching the progress, it was 
        finally finished and all the pieces could be removed. Using my hands and a hammer when joints 
        were tough to get together, I managed to assemble the box. The final step now is to find something to 
        put in the box.
