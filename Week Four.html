      I hope that my professor won't take points off if I say that I hate this machine with every fiber of 
      my being. Sorry for being dramatic. I used it a total of three times and 66% of the time I used it I 
      encountered and error that kept me from working. When I was being trained the machine broke down for like 
      an hour and when it finally decided to work again, the training had taken twice as long as it was 
      supposed to. When I went for the first time to do my actual project, random parts fell out of the machine 
      at somepoint and the machine was out of commision four like 3 days. Luckily I had zero issues the third 
      time I used it, maybe it felt bad for being so unreliable earlier.

      The theme that I wanted to go for was "cat." I was inspired by the video which explained line drawings,
      in which the narrator drew a cute owl. I really like cats and wanted to make an animal. I also missed my 
      cat from home, who I will add a photo of at the bottom! My company I decided, would be called "Cat Bag," 
      and they would sell bags with a little cute cat logo on it. Like the bag I made myself. I knew that I 
      wanted the cat to look simple, because it was supposed to be a line drawing, but I was also worried that 
      the more complicated I tried to make it, the worse it could look. If I tried to add too many details, it 
      may stop looking like a cat. For the color I decided to go with two colorful eyes for the cat becasue 
      I though it went best with my design.
      Now no one has ever said that I was a good artist, and if someone did, they would be lying. I tried my 
      best to come up with some simple line drawn cats, with varrying levels of success and accuracy. The one 
      that I ended up going with was the second from the left on the top row.

    So I totally forgot to document the color choosing. I essentially choose the same color as the video because
    I thought that it looked really good, and knew that in the end I could change the color when I was 
    actually using the machine. I started my design by drawing a perfect circle for the outline of my cat. Next, 
    I tried to draw and ear that looked good. I wasn't really happy with the ones I drew by hand on the paper, and 
    wanted the ear to look better online. I used the line drawer and then pulled and dragged it around until I 
    was happy with the shape. Next, I copied the ear I made and mirrored it to the other side of my cat. 
    Then, I added two big eyes to my cat and a nose. With the mouth, I decided to deviate a bit from the 
    original drawing and really curve it up to one side, so it looked like he was smirking. I wanted the cat
    to look a little mischievous, becasue, if we're being honest, thats how cats are. I considered making the 
    cat more complicated than this, but ultimately liked where it was here. I actually planned on adding whiskers, 
    but forgot to. Next I started on the frame. First, I added a large circle around the cat and adjusted it so that 
    it was closer to a semi-circle. Then I cut out the top section that over lapped the cat. Unfortunately, 
    I forgot to get a photo of before I cut that part out. Next I cut out a section below the cat, and 
    made a whole for where the text would go. For the text, I went to font squirrel and looked through 
    their catalog. I finally decided on the font "Bree Serif" because it looked fun, but it was still readable.
    I typed the word "cat" in there to see how it looked, and liked it. I downloaded the font and added it to 
    my library of fonts. Returning to illustrator, I added the text and choose my new font. I added "Cat Bag" 
    under the picture of the cat. Then I thought that it would look cool if the text sort of transformed into the 
    frame. I made the text larger and larger until it touched both of the lines and looked as if it was connected.

    So turns out that Liam is very stupid and forgot to take a photo of me using premier+. I basically plugged 
    the flash drive that I had into the computer, downloaded the file, and threw it into Premier plus as a 
    hoop Embroidery. Then I sent it to the machine, saving it as "catface."

    Once I found it on the machie I began the printing process. I started with the grey outline of the cat and then did 
    the blue eyes. I had to do this twice, since the first time the machine stopped working halfway through and 
    had to be repaired.

    So obviously I choose purple as one of the colors of my bag, but I wanted to make a two layered bag, so I 
    choose pink for the inside of the bag. I choose blue for the part that houses the rope. First I cut out a 
    second piece of purple, 12" X 12," and then two pink pieces of the same size. Then I cut out two 12" x 2" 
    pieces of blue. The first bit of sewing the folded bit of blue between the pink and purple sheets, making 
    a loop for the rope to go through. I did this twice for each side. Then I began sewing the bag together.
    I did this insideout so that the seems would not be seen from the outside. Once I sewed all the way around, double 
    stiching as the start and end, I turned the bag right side out. The last step I had to do was measure, cut, and 
    add the rope.
