          <p class="w3-large">My name is William Griese, but I normally go by Liam. 
            I am from Franklin Tenessee, but have lived in a few different places growing up. I had always planned on 
            coming back up to the Northeast for college because I used to live in New Jersey and missed the area. So when 
            I was looking for colleges Wheaton stood out! I am currently a Junior at wheaton college studying 
            Economics with a minor in both history and math.
            I hope to pursue a carear in econonmics or a related field after graduating. In my spare time 
            outside of class I play
            rugby at Wheaton. I am extremely excited to be back in person on campus again, and to hopefully be 
            able to play games later this year. I also really like hiking and cooking as well.
            I took this class becasue it looked extremely interesting to me. As a kid I always lovede to build things.
            Legos were my absolute favorite toy as a child and for a long time I wanted to be an 
            engineer or architect. In high school I was on the robotics team for several years and my senior
            year I served as the build captain for the team. I think this class is going to be really fun and I hope to
            learn skills that I will have for the rest of my life.
