        <p class="w3-justify"><b><font size="+1.5">Introduction</font></b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">The first week of Digital Fabrication was all about making the website
            that we would continue to use for the rest of the semester. We will use this webite to docment and
            turn in all furture projects, which made this week very important. The process of making the 
            webiste itself had to be documented as well, and is described below. I have had a few 
            coding classes in high school, however, none in college. And even though I have had coding 
            classes in the past, I have never done any website desing, meaning that basically everything this 
            week was completely new to me.</p></font>

        <img src="Photos/week one/github sign up-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">I will admit that there were a few steps before this that 
            I forgot to document, I hope that I can be forgiven for my oversight. Before setting up Github, I 
            downloaded Visual Studio Code and git. However, the next step after that was going to Github 
            and making an account.

        <img src="Photos/week one/github pages.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">Next I set up the repository and followed the steps that were 
            on the Github Pages to get my website up and online. Using the command prompt shown below.

        <img src="Photos/week one/command prompt-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">While using the command prompt, I ran into my first 
            issue. I am using a windows machine rather than a Mac, and therefore some of the 
            instructions were different for me. Here was one of the first big deviations. Some of the things 
            the command prompt asked me was different that what was shown in the tutorial. For example, it told
            me it didn't recognize me and asked me to identify myself. This was a little confusing but I was 
            albe to overcome it.

        <img src="Photos/week one/Storing it on the computer-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">Using the command prompt I was able to save the 
        repository to my machine, in the documents folder, just as recommended by our professor.

        <img src="Photos/week one/First bit of code up from VSC-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">Unfortunately I forgot to grab a screenshot of when I first 
            put "Hello World" up on the website with the command prompt, but I did get photos of when I put the
            first code into Visual Studio Code and changed it for the first time. This was certainly the biggest success
            yet, as it showed that everything was working and that I could really get started making the meat of
            the website.
