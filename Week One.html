        <p class="w3-justify"><b><font size="+1.5">Introduction</font></b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">The first week of Digital Fabrication was all about making the website
            that we would continue to use for the rest of the semester. We will use this webite to docment and
            turn in all furture projects, which made this week very important. The process of making the 
            webiste itself had to be documented as well, and is described below. I have had a few 
            coding classes in high school, however, none in college. And even though I have had coding 
            classes in the past, I have never done any website desing, meaning that basically everything this 
            week was completely new to me.</p></font>

        <p class="w3-justify"><b><font size="+1.5">Setting Up Github</font></b></p>
        <img src="Photos/week one/github sign up-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">I will admit that there were a few steps before this that 
            I forgot to document, I hope that I can be forgiven for my oversight. Before setting up Github, I 
            downloaded Visual Studio Code and git. However, the next step after that was going to Github 
            and making an account.

        <img src="Photos/week one/github pages.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">Next I set up the repository and followed the steps that were 
            on the Github Pages to get my website up and online. Using the command prompt shown below.

        <div class="w3-row w3-padding-8"></div>
        <img src="Photos/week one/command prompt-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">While using the command prompt, I ran into my first 
            issue. I am using a windows machine rather than a Mac, and therefore some of the 
            instructions were different for me. Here was one of the first big deviations. Some of the things 
            the command prompt asked me was different that what was shown in the tutorial. For example, it told
            me it didn't recognize me and asked me to identify myself. This was a little confusing but I was 
            albe to overcome it.

        <img src="Photos/week one/Storing it on the computer-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">Using the command prompt I was able to save the 
        repository to my machine, in the documents folder, just as recommended by our professor.

        <img src="Photos/week one/its on the website-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">Unfortunately I forgot to grab a screenshot of when I first 
            put "Hello World" up on the website with the command prompt, but I did get photos of when I put the
            first code into Visual Studio Code and changed it for the first time. This was certainly the biggest success
            yet, as it showed that everything was working and that I could really get started making the meat of
            the website.

        <img src="Photos/week one/About Me Section-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">I began with the about me section and started to piece together how to design a 
            website. I borrowed a lot from the templates that were availiable on w3 Schools CSS templates. I however, tried
            to change the, enough that it didn't look like I had just copied and pasted them. After a while I wanted to add a 
            photo to the about me section, to spice it up.
            
        </p></font>
        <div class="w3-row w3-padding-8"></div>
        <img src="Photos/week one/first photo!-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">I asked some of my friends, who had worked with html before, how I would go
            about adding photos. Between their advice, and the help of the templates, I was able to figure out how to 
            add a photo of me to the about me page. I would later go on to add more photos of myself to the front page 
            and of course add a lot of photos to this page itself.
        </p></font>
        <div class="w3-row w3-padding-32"></div>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b><font size="+1.5">Colors and Home</font></b></p>
        <img src="Photos/week one/Home Page-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">After I finished the "About me Section" of the website, I moved on to the Home 
            Page itself. Here I experimented around with designs and tried to make my website look a little better than just 
            blakc and white. I played aorund with the colors until a found a shade of blue that I liked and figured out, with 
            the help of a coder friend, how to add the colored boxes around the tops of the page to make it look more official.
        </p></font>

        <img src="Photos/week one/Makeing the repository-min.PNG" style="width: 775px;" >
        <p class="w3-justify"> <font size="+1.5">Finally, after I completed the Home Page, I began to collect the photos that 
            I had taken of my process and compile them to begin making this page. I used an online compressor becasue I was being a 
            little lazy and didn't know, or want to learn right now, how to compress them myself. I used the skills I learned earlier, 
            such as how to format and add photos, to make this page look professional. All in all, I don't think that this project took me 
            the full 15 hours that I was worried it was going to take, but it was certainly a lot more work that I had expected. I think 
            that I managed to build a respectable website that serves the purpose it was designed to. I hope that Professor Dunaway approves, and 
            I hope that I get to make another website at some point, becasue I actually really enjoyed the process.
