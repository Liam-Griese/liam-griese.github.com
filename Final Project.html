        I came up with three different ideas for my final project: A large wooden calendar, a cribbage board, 
        an a frame for a photograph. The Calender would be a large grid that wold be cut into a piece of wood. 
        There would be a large number of tiles that would fit into these spaces in the grid. Each of the 
        tiles would have a number on it 1-31. One could rearrange the tiles to reflect any given month. The Cribbage 
        board idea would be a simple cribbage board that would be cut using the shaper and then engraved with a 
        cool design using the laser cutter. I would then design and print 3d pegs to uses as the pieces. The third idea 
        was to make a cool photo frame that had fancy designs engraves on it. At the consultation I discussed 
        the three ideas and I ended up deciding to go with the Cribbage board idea. Of all of the ideas this was the 
        most personal to me. Me and my family play a lot of cribbage and so it would be used a lot at home. Also 
        my Great-Uncle used to make cribbage boards, so I think it would be really fun to do the same. I decided 
        as well that I would make the Cribbage board a Christmas gift for my sister. The three skeches are attached below.

    I began the process of designing my cribbage board by making a canvas that was the size of the piece of wood 
    the shaper would be able to handle. I knew that the board I could make would have to be smaller than that.
    Then I started to make the holes that would go into the Cribbage board. There are 120 holes in a standard 
    board and the smallest I would be able to make them would be 1/4 of an inch, becasue that is the size of the 
    shaper bit. Next I put 30 holes in a row across the width of the board, making sure that all of the holes 
    were the same size and equal distrance from one another. Then I copied the 30 holes and pasted then thrice 
    above, so that there were 4 rows of 30 holes. My final design will be wih the shaper, but the first iteration 
    of my design, I made it with the laser cutter. I did ths so I could see how the 1/4 holes would look and how 
    the board looked when it was printed. The laser cutter allowed me to do with quickly and effectively. 
    Photos of the first prototype are below.
