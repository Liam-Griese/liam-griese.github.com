      So for this project I wanted to return to my roots and stick Jackson's face on something.
      I decided to make a little pun and make a sign that had his face and then spelle out "Light of 
      My Life." Since the sign would eventually be lit up- this would be hilarious. I started first by 
      importing the base of the sign file that was posted on the website, that way I knew what the bases' 
      size was going to be and I could deisgn the rest of the sign around it. Next  I made a reactangle 
      that was as wide as the base. Then I rounded the corners of the rectangle. Since I didn't know how to 
      ony curve the top corners of the reactangle, I had to do some cutting and reconnecting. 
      I took the top of the rounded rectangle and added it to the bottom of the regualr rectangle. Then I 
      attached the rectancgle to the base. Finally I added Jackson's face and the text below the face. I 
      decided to use comic sans as the font becuase I thought it would add to the comedy.

    To start I modeled the bottom wooden plate in fusion 360. Then I made a line that was 1.5 mm out from the 
    bottom plate. I extruded this the height of the plate. Then I went up a good bit. An inch or two, and made an 
    offset plane. On this offset plane I modeled the top piece of the box. I repeated the same process as I did 
    with the first piece and made a line that was 1.5 mm larger on all sides than the upper part of the top piece. 
    Then I extruded it to be the same height at the top part of the box. Then I extruded it all the way to the ground, 
    so that it connected with the rim I made around the bottom piece of the box. Then I removed the top and bottom piece 
    and used a sketch and 'cut' to make the hole for the power.

  The first time I went to print my design it kept failing over and over again. It was the worst. Five times 
  my print failed becasue the machine was being annoying and the others (including the one I had initially booked) 
  were taken. Ultimately I sent Madison the files and she printed the deisng for me the next day. This first iteration, 
  however, was much too wide- I had overestimated how much the model would shrink as it cooled. I went back to 
  fusion and shrunk it down quite a bit, so that it was only .1 mm wider than the plates. I printed this and it 
  was much better. It fit very well.

    The circuit buidling training was one of the harder ones I have had to do. First we had to use a machine to 
    cut the circuit boards. This was done in two waves by two differnt drill bits. The first one just ingraved the copper 
    so that it would work as a ciruit board, the second bit cutt it out into shape. Once that was done, I had 
    to use solder and a heat gun to assemble the ciruit board with the power pins, capacitors, and the resistors. 
    Once this was done, the circuit board was complete. Unfortunately the boards we made were not the ones that 
    were used in the final project.
